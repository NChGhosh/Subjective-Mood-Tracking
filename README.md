# Mini-Mood-Tracking Application
ilt as a prototype, the application aims to increase self-awareness by visualizing trends and providing simple, data-driven conclusions.

Core Functionalities:

    Digital Activity Tracking: The application runs in the background to passively monitor and record active computer usage, providing a quantitative measure of engagement.

    Subjective Mood Input: Users can actively log their current emotional state through an intuitive color selection interface.

    HSB-Based Sentiment & Emotion Analysis: A key feature is the use of a simplified HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) analysis of the chosen color. This approach, inspired by color psychology principles, 
    moves beyond arbitrary color-to-emotion mapping to derive a sentiment score (+1, 0, -1) and a corresponding emotion label based on the color's properties.

    Local Data Storage: All collected activity and subjective mood data is stored locally in CSV files, ensuring user privacy and control over their personal information.

    Weekly Mood Visualization: The application generates a clear weekly plot showing the trend of the user's average mood sentiment over time, allowing for easy identification of patterns.

    Simple Insights: Based on the analysis of recent subjective mood entries, the application provides a concise textual conclusion offering a basic assessment of the user's current well-being state.
